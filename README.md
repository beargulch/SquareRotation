# SquareRotation Notes

1. To add a dancer or a couple, press the “Add dancer” button.

  - Some dancers will dance in a couple, and some will dance single.  The “Add dancer” dialog box is designed to handle both cases, and can be used to enter either 1 or 2 dancers.  The dancer(s) entered can be 1 or 2 singles, or 1 couple.

  - Dancers are added individually, regardless of whether they are dancing in a couple.  Do not add “Joe and Nancy” as one dancer.  Add Nancy as Dancer 1 and Joe as Dancer 2, or vice versa; order does not matter.  If the 2 dancers will be dancing together as a couple, check the box labeled “Are Dancer 1 and Dancer 2 dance partners?” to pair the 2 dancers..

  - To enter a single dancer, fill out the “Dancer 1” portion, and press Save.

  - To enter a couple, fill out both the “Dancer 1” and “Dancer 2” portions, and check the box labeled “Are Dancer 1 and Dancer 2 dance partners?”.  Press Save.

  - To enter 2 single dancers, fill out both the “Dancer 1” and “Dancer 2” portions, and do NOT check the box labeled “Are Dancer 1 and Dancer 2 dance partners?”.  Press Save.

  - Dancers who are incorrectly paired with another dancer, or who should be paired with their partner but are not, can easily be paired or un-paired after they have been entered and the “Add dancer” dialog box has been dismissed.

2. Fields on the “Edit Dancer” dialog box

  - Dancer 1 Name:
  
  Enter the name of the dancer as it will appear in the display.  IMPORTANT:  because the program pairs single dancers, names must be unique so single dancers can tell who they are paired with.  If there are 2 single Michaels, for example, a display that shows “Michael and Sue” and “Michael and Jane” would be ambiguous.  

  The program will disallow 2 dancers with identical names, so add something like a last initial to the names to make them unique:  “Michael L” and “Michael W”, for example.  If there are 2  Michaels with a last name that begins with “L”, add as many characters as necessary to establish uniqueness.
